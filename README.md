If you want to play this game, go to the build folder on the root of the program and click on the executable file the game is a WIP (Work In Progress) so the game is not complete, however, we hope that you find our progress satisfactory so far.

# TO INSPECT SOURCE CODE

To find the code files, go to the git>Assets>Scripts to find all the scripts, the Data and sprites are on their respective folders inside
the assets folder. If you want to see the data in-depth, you have to install Unity and open the project using the Unity Editor 2019.2.15f1

- *[NOTE]* Local path matters as it is where the file will be stored
- *[RECOMMENDATION]* Create a file called GitHub under one of your drives and save that as your local path. For example, my path for github repos is under my z drive 'Z:\GitHub'
5. Then click 'Fetch Origin' at the top taskbar (this updates you with the latest version from github.com)

10. Adding the GitHub project to your Unity Hub
- *A* Go to the Projects tab on the Unity Hub
- *B* Click 'Add', then locate the folder you saved the github repo in (step 4)
